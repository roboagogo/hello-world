# Hello Book

This is the first sample in the book. This sample started by typing `dotnet new` and creating an empty project. In the book,
we added the ASP.NET dependencies and modified `Program.cs` as well as created `Startup.cs` to add some simple "Hello World"
middleware.

To run this sample:

```
$ dotnet restore
```
Then:
```
$ dotnet run
```

To invoke the middleware and see the results, simply `curl http://localhost:5000/any/url`
